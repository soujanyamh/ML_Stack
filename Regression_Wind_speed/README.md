About this Dataset
Context
High precision and reliable wind speed forecasting is a challenge for meteorologists. Severe wind due to convective storms, causes considerable damages (large scale forest damage, outage, buildings/houses damage, etc.). Convective events such as thunderstorms, tornadoes as well as large hail, strong winds, are natural hazards that have the potential to disrupt daily life, especially over complex terrain favoring the initiation of convection. Even ordinary convective events produce severe winds which causes fatal and costly damages. Therefore, wind speed prediction is an important task to get advanced severe weather warning. This dataset contains the responses of a weather sensor that collected different weather variables such as temperatures and precipitation.

Content
The dataset contains 6574 instances of daily averaged responses from an array of 5 weather variables sensors embedded in a meteorological station. The device was located on the field in a significantly empty area, at 21M. Data were recorded from January 1961 to December 1978 (17 years). Ground Truth daily averaged precipitations, maximum and minimum temperatures, and grass minimum temperature were provided.
