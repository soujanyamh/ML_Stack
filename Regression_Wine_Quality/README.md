Wine Quality Data Set (Red & White Wine)

•	About this file
•	This data set contains records related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. It contains information from 1599 red wine samples and 4898 white wine samples. Input variables in the data set consist of the type of wine and metrics from objective tests, while the target/output variable is a numerical score based on sensory data from wine experts. Please refer to the data set description for more details.

About this Dataset
Data Set Information
This data set contains records related to red and white variants of the Portuguese Vinho Verde wine. It contains information from 1599 red wine samples and 4898 white wine samples. Input variables in the data set consist of the type of wine (either red or white wine) and metrics from objective tests (e.g. acidity levels, PH values, ABV, etc.), while the target/output variable is a numerical score based on sensory data—median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Due to privacy and logistic issues, there is no data about grape types, wine brand, and wine selling price.

This data set is a combined version of the two separate files (distinct red and white wine data sets) originally shared in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The following are some existing data sets on Kaggle from the same source (with notable differences from this data set):
•	Red Wine Quality (contains red wine data only)
•	Wine Quality (combination of red and white wine data but with some values randomly removed)
•	Wine Quality (red and white wine data not combined)
