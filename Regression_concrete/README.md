CEMENT STRENGTH PREDICTION
 
Problem Statement:
To build a machine learning model to predict the concrete compressive strength of cement
Data Description :
Context Concrete is the most used material for construction in the world! There are some components that should be combined to make the concrete. These components can affect the compressive strength of the concrete. To obtain the real compressive strength of concrete (target labels in the dataset), an engineer needs to break the cylinder samples under the compression-testing machine. The failure load is divided by the cylinder's cross-section to obtain the compressive strength. Engineers use different kinds of concretes for different building purposes. For example, the strength of concrete used for residential buildings should not be lower than 2500 psi (17.2 MPa). Concrete is a material with high strength in compression, but low strength in tension. That is why engineers use reinforced concrete (usually with steel rebars) to build structures.
Content Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit, and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
